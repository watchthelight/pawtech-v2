## Art DM's and No Tolerance for DM Advertising

To protect our members from potential scams, we do not allow users to DM others about selling artwork without explicit consent or a request from the user. Violating this rule may result in a ban for DM ADVERTISING.

### Rules Regarding the Use of AI

1. The use of AI art posting within art channels is not allowed. This does not include AI-generated memes that would go in memes channel.

1a. AI art commissions are not allowed. This goes without saying.

2. Asking for people's art to feed into AI is not allowed even if the images are willingly given. If the picture is used to feed AI without the provider knowing that was what the image would be used for, there will be actions taken against the person who used the AI.

3. Using AI to gather ideas or brainstorm is allowed as long as you do not use the AI as your final piece, trace, or redraw certain aspects of the AI to claim the art as your own. If you use AI to brainstorm you must disclose this when posting the piece.

4. The selling and promotion of AI-made adoptable characters is not allowed.

Within Pawtropolis we do not support the use of AI to take the place of artists and recognize the harm that is being done with the use and growing popularity of AI. The breaking of these rules will result in disciplinary action that is most likely a ban from the server.

We encourage you to improve your art skills and support human artists. The excuse of not being able to afford art will not be valid within this server. We have an art request channel and an art trade channel you can use to find "free" art.

## Harassment & Trolling

Any form of harassment or bullying towards another user is against our terms, and may be actionable based on the severity of the content. This rule applies to, but not limited to:

- Any descriptors that target a specific group or individual in a hateful matter
- Homophobia, sexism, transphobia, racism, antisemitism, xenophobia, etc.
- Posting other users' private info without their consent (this includes selfies)
- Topics that may be sensitive to another user

Trolling goes without saying, and is not allowed. This is a community for people to enjoy and feel safe. If you are caught trolling and or raiding, you will automatically be banned.

## Listen to Staff

A Staff member's role is to keep a peaceful and friendly environment. It's important to listen to Staff instructions. Things such as ignoring or arguing with a staff member can lead to actionable offenses. Be mindful of other in chat, and it's the main reason we don't want users to cause an issue with staff, as it ruins the community for the rest.

- Blocking Staff is allowed as they're technically any other Discord User, (However, if a staff member cannot contact you or you don't see their instruction, you'll be punished as such, and will be held liable for your actions).
- All Staff are required to follow the rules like you do
- Do not find loopholes
- If you have an issue with a staff member, please make a ticket, and ping @Leadership with the caption "reporting a staff user".

Please be wise and understand that staff do not want to punish users. Working together to keep a fun environment is the ultimate goal.

## Avoid Drama & Touchy Subjects

Do NOT seek to make other members uncomfortable or start conflict within the server. We do not tolerate drama and arguments within public chats.

## Warnings & Punishments

Users that violate our terms are subject to actionable offenses. Your punishment is dependent on the severity of the content. You are responsible to follow our guidelines, and breaking so, will lead to punishment. If you ever feel as punishments are unfair, it's best to make a ticket to sort it out. We only want the best for our users, and believe that actions are forgiven if followed.

### How Does Our Moderation System Work?

Most of our moderation is handled by auto-mod which follows the same guide as manually.

- We manage a 3 strike rule.
- 3 strikes = 1w mute
- Strikes fall off 30d after
- If you receive 3 warnings within 14 days, it may lead up to further actions.

## Art Bases

Users are allowed to post artwork with both P2U and F2U bases within Pawtropolis as long as proper credit is given. Posts using bases without credit will be deleted and you will be asked to repost it with proper credit attached.

It is unfair to base artists when you use their assets without credit. You are claiming creative liberty of their original work and trying to pass it off as your own which is art theft. Art theft might seem harmless at first but overtime there are huge consequences such as copyright infringement, money loss, and even more. Please respect artists and their work and properly credit them.

## Art Commission Ad Posting

Artists are allowed to post their art commission ads in the commissions channel once a day as a general rule. If there are less than 10 posts between your previous commission post DO NOT post your ad again even if it's after the 24 hour period.

- Commission ads should be less than 15 lines in length. A good measure to this length without counting is if your entire message is able to be seen on mobile without scrolling.
- A maximum of 9 images/videos are allowed to be attached to commission advertisements.

Commission advertisements that break this rules will now be deleted and users that continually break these rules will have punishment as follows:

1. Warning
2. Warning
3. Warning
4. Removal of Artist role
