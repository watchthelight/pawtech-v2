| `skullmode` | Random skull emoji reactions |
| `pingdevonapp` | Ping Bot Dev on new applications |

### Role Automation Setup

Configure automatic role assignments based on Amaribot levels and event attendance.

**Commands:**
- `/roles add-level-tier level:N role:@Role` — Connect an Amaribot level to a role
- `/roles add-level-reward level:N role:@Role` — Give a one-time token role at a level
- `/roles add-movie-tier tier_name:Name role:@Role movies_required:N` — Set up movie attendance tiers
- `/roles add-game-tier tier_name:Name role:@Role games_required:N` — Set up game attendance tiers
- `/roles list type:...` — See all configured mappings
- `/roles remove-level-tier level:N` — Delete a level tier
- `/roles remove-level-reward level:N` — Delete a level reward
- `/roles remove-movie-tier tier_name:Name` — Delete a movie tier
- `/roles remove-game-tier tier_name:Name` — Delete a game tier

**Level Tiers vs Level Rewards:**
- **Level Tiers** are the roles Amaribot assigns (like "Engaged Fur LVL 15")
- **Level Rewards** are bonus roles you give at milestones (like "Event Ticket")

📋 *Introduced in [v1.1.0](../CHANGELOG.md#110---2025-11-25)*

### Emergency Controls

When role automation goes wrong, you can stop everything immediately.

**Commands:**
- `/panic on` — **STOP** all automatic role grants right now
- `/panic off` — Resume normal operation
- `/panic status` — Check if panic mode is currently on

**When to hit the panic button:**
- Roles going to wrong people
- Duplicate roles being added
- Any weird role behavior you don't understand
- Before making configuration changes (just to be safe)

**Important:** Panic mode survives bot restarts. It stays on until you turn it off.

📋 *Introduced in [v1.1.1](../CHANGELOG.md#111---2025-11-25)*

### Advanced Statistics

Export and manage moderator statistics for performance reviews.

**Commands:**
- `/modstats export days:N` — Download stats as CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- `/modstats reset password:...` — Reset all metrics to start fresh (nuclear option)

**Export includes:**
- Every action (accepts, rejects, kicks)
- Timestamps and response times
- Reasons given for rejections
- Application IDs for reference

**When to reset:**
- New moderation team
- Significant policy changes
- Testing cleanup before going live
- Fresh start for a new season

📋 *Introduced in [v1.0.0](../CHANGELOG.md#100---2025-11-25)*

### Review System Configuration

Fine-tune how the review system notifies staff about new applications.

**Commands:**
- `/review-set-notify-config` — Set up notifications for new forum posts
  - `mode`: post (reply in thread) or channel (send to separate channel)
  - `role`: Which role to ping
  - `forum`: Which forum to watch
  - `cooldown`: Seconds between notifications
  - `max_per_hour`: Cap on notifications per hour
- `/review-get-notify-config` — View current notification settings
- `/review-set-listopen-output mode:...` — Control if `/listopen` is public or ephemeral

## Tips for This Level

1. **Test config changes carefully** — One wrong setting can break the workflow for your whole team
2. **Document your role mappings** — Keep notes on why each level tier and reward exists
3. **Use panic mode proactively** — Turn it on before making changes, not after things break
4. **Review exports regularly** — Monthly stats reviews help catch burnout early
5. **Check `/config view` periodically** — Make sure settings haven't drifted
