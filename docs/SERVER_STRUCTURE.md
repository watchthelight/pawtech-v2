# Welcome to PawtropolisMC! <a:5952shulkerclose:1243706924873285673> 

A 10-month project started in early 2024, was a server with a primary goal. "To support others with entertainment."

## What is PawtropolisMC?

PawtropolisMC is a 24/7 Minecraft server running on version 1.18.2. Its purpose is based on a prison economy system, where you mine blocks in order to gain currency. You can use this currency toward our current and future features that come to the server. The goal is to envision some of our past lore when we release things such as our story mode or SMP. This area will act as our main hub to control all players. As an owner who keeps themselves open-minded, we will never induce gambling. This is in reference to crate keys. This will NEVER be a thing sold on a future store. Our goal with a future shop is to add things that will not push P2W, and a portion of the revenue will be used to support our local artists in Pawtropolis. 

This is a way to provide entertainment and support our community members. 

### Key Notes

When you attempt to connect to the server, you may be prompted to DM a bot with a code. This bot can be found in our **Minecraft ** Discord Server, which you are required to join in order to connect to the server. 

Once you connect, you will spawn in our main hub area. A list of guides are provided in the other Discord, inside of https://discord.com/channels/1201631183730114631/1202750755753173054. This includes how our rank system works, commands, and our advanced enchantments. Advanced enchantments should help the balance between players and how they want to use their weapons to fight others in a PVP scenario. We are currently working on a **PvE mode** that allows you fight passively without the need of other players. It will most likely be a round based, where mobs can drop certain items or improve your skill level. 

**Use /customkits to get your miner's pickaxe!**

### Bug/Support 

We encourage everyone to report bugs or seek support when needed. This is a brand new server that may not all be perfect. We when through our 10 day period of BETA testing and was able to fix multiple issues before a full release. 

`You can report your bugs here: ` https://dyno.gg/form/22de6295
`You submit suggestions here:` https://dyno.gg/form/85f3deaa
We recommend using our ticket system in the **PawtropolisMC Discord** for server support and not here. Keeps thing organized.

**IP Address:** pawtropolis.mc.gg
**Versions:** *1.18.2* (We do support up to 1.21.4, however, lag may occur. These are just supported versions. We are not liable for loss on these versions).

# Mental Health <:heart_support:1166835434454794240> 

I've been thinking about ways to make this space more supportive for everyone. As the owner, I want to let you know that we won't be introducing a venting channel. I also want to discourage venting directly to others through DMs. Here's why:

Not everyone you connect with here is a trained professional in providing support. Sharing personal struggles with someone who
lacks experience can have unintended negative consequences for both parties. As someone currently immersed in the health field 
and studying psychology, I understand firsthand the challenges of being a support therapist and maintaining a high standard of care. 
I believe in creating an environment that prioritizes the well-being of our members. Instead of a venting channel, 
I encourage open discussions, positive interactions, and mutual support within our broader community.

I want to stress the importance of seeking professional help when needed. I've included some resources below that might be helpful for you:

# Byte Tokens <:ByteMythic:1381886074586005574> 

-# *"A fur citizen wished upon a shooting star. A large orb like capsule shoots over the city horizon with a roar in the sky. and connects with the face of the earth. The citizen approaches the capsule. The capsule creeks open... A new arrival awaits..."*

## What is a Byte?

> A Byte is an item that can be redeemed to boost your leveling experience. They will be only available through giveaways & rewards for the time being. As it gains more popularity, we will add them to the @Paw Bank shop for purchase. 

## Byte Types <:Leveling:1385050835901485217> 
`Byte:` A "personal" token used to boost leveling experience. This can be redeemable and only applies to your profile
`AllByte:` A token that applies "globally" throughout the community. 

**Every Byte will have the same or a different multiplier level and duration. Each byte also comes with a rarity**

`Bytes have 5 rarity types:` 

[ <:ByteCommon:1381901926190420008> ] - Common Byte
- *The most common Byte Token.* It has a 2x multiplier and can last 12 hours.
[ <:ByteRare:1381901931735289856> ] - Rare Byte
- *If you look hard enough, you may find yourself a rare byte.* They can have a 3x multiplier and last up to 24 hours. 
[ <:ByteEpic:1381901930061762570> ] - Epic Byte
- *People used to mine a bunch of these in the past which makes them so rare now, but they're out there, falling out of the sky.* It last for 48 hours and has a 5x multiplier.
[ <:ByteLegendary:1381901928111538206> ] - Legendary Byte
- *Legends say there was none left on the planet, but people kept searching and rumors spread.* It can last up to 72 hours and have a 5x multiplier. 
[ <:ByteMythic:1381886074586005574> ] - Mythic Byte 
*No one has seen one before and rumors almost say it doesn't exist. There's nothing out there that isn't hidden..* Almost a myth but some have also said it lasts up to a whole week, and has a 10x multiplier. However, that's up to speculation. 

**AllBytes can only be found in Epic or Higher rarites, but have the same levels as regular Bytes.**
## How to redeem?

> In order to redeem them you will need to have the item itself. This can be managed via <@493716749342998541>. All info and guides on how <@493716749342998541> (our currency bot) works, please check out <#1385051265976762498>. If you have been given the item or have bought it from the shop, you can use /inventory to check your items. If you see any byte items in your inventory, great!

> To use the item, you will need to use the command /shop use (item). This will remove the item from your inventory. It'll give you the role corresponding to it's level and duration. After having the role on your profile, you will need to make a ticket to redeem the token. A staff member will process the token for you and will activate the role. 

> This also works the same for **AllBytes**. A staff member would have to activate it. However global xp boosters would get announced in <#1381923831102574675>.

## How to find them? 

Byte Tokens can be found in many places and ranging different rarities.

> - /Shop view (can be pricey)
> - Giveaways
> - Event Awards
> - Server Rewards
> - Special Chat Drops 

Note: Byte Items will swap out with different rarites in shop so be on the look out!

**Due to the nature of having to track these in your account. Only one role will can be attached and redeemed in your account one time.**

-# e.g, You can earn one <@&1385194838890119229> but can't get another <@&1385194838890119229> until that previous token is redeemed. You may still have other rarities in the same account. 
### Be on the lookout!
