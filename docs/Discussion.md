## Initial Report

**watchthelight** (15:16):
> I just thought we should be consistent is all

**watchthelight** (15:16):
> And I am trying to kick this guy so I hope he doesn't change it

**watchthelight** (15:17):
> That FreakySomeone server is a disgusting place

**electromutt** (15:17):
> oh I know

**watchthelight** (15:17):
> Okay good

**electromutt** (15:18):
> that tag will have no place in any server I have jurisdiction over

---

## Discussion Begins

**wwerew0lf** (22:17):
> I don't see anything in their bio

**wwerew0lf** (22:17):
> It's just them as a person

**electromutt** (22:19):
> Indeed

**wwerew0lf** (22:20):
> Do we have a rule on server tag?

**watchthelight** (22:20):
> For this server, yes

**electromutt** (22:20):
> Freaky being used as a server tag plus that server is a nono

**electromutt** (22:20):
> Bad x Bad

**wwerew0lf** (22:21):
> mhm

**watchthelight** (22:21):
> I don't want anyone here being led to that place

**wwerew0lf** (22:21):
> Something to discuss in a future meeting

**electromutt** (22:21):
> This

**watchthelight** (22:22):
> Sure!

## Policy Considerations

**wwerew0lf** (22:22):
> Not saying what you're doing is bad, but I think we need to limit ourselves when it comes to verifying user profiles.

**wwerew0lf** (22:22):
> That's when it becomes discord's job.

**watchthelight** (22:23):
> I completely agree and I let my personal vendetta against this server leak into here and I apologize

**wwerew0lf** (22:23):
> He does have nitro so another way is for him to set a server profile tag

**wwerew0lf** (22:23):
> I think

**watchthelight** (22:23):
> I think that.. works let me look

**watchthelight** (22:23):
> Nah

**watchthelight** (22:23):
> No per-server guild tag

**wwerew0lf** (22:23):
> nvm that was with the nameplate/name styles

## Meeting Scheduled

**watchthelight** (22:28):
> The meeting is this weekend, no?

**watchthelight** (22:28):
> I could check for myself actually

**wwerew0lf** (22:28):
> Uhhh saturday

## Debate on Enforcement

**electromutt** (22:38):
> Discord's job my ass, they won't do anything.

**electromutt** (22:39):
> Unless they are legally threatened to.

**electromutt** (22:40):
> We should have some degree of protection for our younger userbase

**wwerew0lf** (22:40):
> Same reason for our outside server policy. If rules don't line up it contradicts our original policy and puts us in the same jeopardy of drama.

**electromutt** (22:40):
> Alright then

**wwerew0lf** (22:41):
> You are right, and I vow to work with y'all to make it right, but I also have a duty to protect you guys.

## Proposed Solution

**watchthelight** (22:41):
> I HAVE AN IDEA

**watchthelight** (22:41):
> add something to the rules like "We do not allow server tags that lead to servers that break ToS" or something, and then we can just loosely enforce it outside of the freakysomeone server

**watchthelight** (22:42):
> Like obviously we wouldn't care about vencord or sm like that

**wwerew0lf** (22:42):
> Let me see if tags have their own rules. I bet they do

**electromutt** (22:42):
> Frankly I would rather protect this server from exposure like that than allow it here because "Discord doesn't enforce it"

**electromutt** (22:42):
> Its clearly shown on users here

**wwerew0lf** (22:42):
> If discord enforces it, then we enforce it here

**electromutt** (22:42):
> A "Freak Zone" tag

**electromutt** (22:43):
> Well even if they don't (they don't) we still should enforce it.

## Cooling Down

**watchthelight** (22:43):
> I think we should slow the conversation down a bit :3 maybe even look at what rules we already have and write up some talking points for the meeting

**watchthelight** (22:43):
> I have a whiteboard in my office prepared lmao

**electromutt** (22:43):
> Agreed

**wwerew0lf** (22:43):
> I will look into if there are rules enforced by Discord's Team

**wwerew0lf** (22:44):
> All points matter

**electromutt** (22:44):
> Discord Team is not our team.

**electromutt** (22:44):
> It's irrelevant if they do, if we wish to

**wwerew0lf** (22:44):
> No, but every context provides better clarity

**electromutt** (22:45):
> Nodnod

**wwerew0lf** (22:46):
> It's a fair right to our rules and guidelines, because we may never see another end or option. A reason I open my ears to "everything"

## Team Dynamics

**electromutt** (22:47):
> Mmmm

**watchthelight** (22:47):
> I respect the way this team talks

**wwerew0lf** (22:47):
> It's respectful. I understand Electro's view and he has a right to feel that way.

**wwerew0lf** (22:47):
> We will work together to find a solution

**watchthelight** (22:48):
> Rah

**wwerew0lf** (22:48):
> I won't make final decisions without everyone agreeing

---

## Detailed Positions

**electromutt** (22:50):
> Allowing such a thing does make the server lighter and more welcoming, but my concern is allowing those things to even be displayed, to me is immortal. It's clear the reason why that is what it is, "The Freak Zone". Being exposed to such things at all, let alone minors, is just poor behavior and shouldn't be tolerated. Then again more behind it that Bash understands, we have a duty to protect our userbase even if some do not understand why or don't like it.

**watchthelight** (22:52):
> I do not believe that we should enforce drama from external servers.
>
> I believe we should keep The Freak Zone server **airgapped** from this one. I've been there, for two months ish before I left, and... wow.
>
> I do not know how this line is drawn or how our rules allow for this or what needs to be talked about but the end result whatever it may be, in my respectful opinion needs to be what I said.

**electromutt** (22:52):
> This is one of my actively canned responses for how much of a threat I consider those tags.
> *(attached image)*

**electromutt** (22:53):
> At least there is the one place I'm in that actually strictly enforces them

---

## Resolution

**wwerew0lf** (22:54):
> For now I think the best course of action is to enforce that tag. @electromutt you are right, safety is more important and without a proper ruling for this, it does more harm to wait without a rule we don't have. We will bring this up in our next senior meeting to ensure that this is something we need to enforce.

**electromutt** (22:55):
> Thank you

---

## Follow-up

**watchthelight** (22:58):
> lets do some thinktanking what you think

**watchthelight** (22:58):
> About what rules we have and maybe how they can be better phrased

**electromutt** (22:58):
> Mutt lub yappin

**electromutt** (22:59):
> Lez dance

## Key Takeaways

2. **Concern:** Protecting younger users from being led to inappropriate content
3. **Debate:** Balance between overreaching into user profiles vs. protecting the community
4. **Temporary Decision:** Enforce against that specific tag for now
5. **Next Steps:** Discuss formally at the upcoming Saturday senior meeting to establish a proper rule
