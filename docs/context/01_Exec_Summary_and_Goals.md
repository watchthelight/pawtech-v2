# 01 â€” Executive Summary and Goals

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** Production-ready (PR6 complete)

## Summary

- **What:** Transparent, auditable Discord moderation toolkit with application review, modmail, and performance analytics
- **Why:** Community managers need visibility into moderator activity, response times, and review pipeline health
- **How:** Discord.js bot + Fastify web panel + SQLite with comprehensive audit logging and metrics engine
- **Current State:** All core features deployed; OAuth2-protected admin panel live; 165/165 tests passing

---

## Value Proposition

Pawtropolis delivers a **transparent moderation pipeline** that transforms opaque Discord moderation into an accountable, data-driven process:

- **Auditable Review Flow:** Every gate application decision (`approve`, `reject`, `kick`) is logged with timestamps, moderator identity, and optional reason text
- **Performance Analytics:** Automated metrics tracking moderator response times (p50/p95 percentiles), claim/approval rates, and workload distribution
- **Web Control Panel:** OAuth2-protected dashboard for viewing logs, exporting analytics, and managing server configuration
- **Joinâ†’Submit Insights:** Track conversion funnel from server join to application submission to identify drop-off points

Built for communities that value **transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement** in their moderation operations.

## Goals

### Core Objectives (Achieved âœ…)

1. **Application Review System** â€” Gatekeeper workflow with claim/decide/audit pipeline
2. **Modmail Ticketing** â€” Private thread-based support system with action logging
3. **Comprehensive Audit Logs** â€” Every action logged with moderator identity, timestamps, and optional reasoning
4. **Performance Metrics** â€” Automated calculation of moderator stats (claims, approvals, response times) with 15-minute refresh
5. **Web Admin Panel** â€” OAuth2-protected dashboard for viewing logs, metrics, and configuration
6. **Banner Sync System** â€” Automatic synchronization of Discord server banner to bot profile and website

### Secondary Goals (In Progress ðŸš§)

7. **Queue Health Monitoring** â€” Alerts for stuck claims, SLA breaches, and reviewer burnout (PR7)
8. **Advanced Analytics** â€” Time-to-first-touch, reviewer efficiency scoring, predictive workload modeling (PR8)
9. **Modmail Enhancements** â€” Rich embeds, attachment handling, canned responses, tag system (PR9)
10. **Observability Polish** â€” Structured logging, distributed tracing, Grafana dashboards (PR10)

## What's Next

### PR7: Queue Health & Monitoring

- Real-time queue depth tracking
- Stuck claim detection (> 2 hours without decision)
- SLA breach alerting (configurable thresholds)
- Reviewer burnout indicators (consecutive decisions without break)

### PR8: Modmail Enhancements

- Rich embed support for ticket replies
- Attachment forwarding between DMs and threads
- Canned response templates
- Tag system for ticket categorization

### PR9: Observability & Polish

- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Prometheus metrics export

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Discord bot commands for moderation workflows
- SQLite database with migration system
- Fastify web server with OAuth2 authentication
- Admin dashboard SPA (vanilla JS)
- Automated metrics calculation and caching
- CSV export for analytics data
- Password-protected configuration changes
- Dynamic banner synchronization

### Out of Scope

- Public-facing website content (separate marketing site)
- Multi-guild support (single guild per bot instance)
- Real-time WebSocket updates (dashboard uses polling)
- Mobile app (responsive web UI only)

## Success Criteria

**Achieved:**

- âœ… Zero unaudited moderation actions
- âœ… Sub-5-minute metrics refresh latency
- âœ… 100% test coverage for critical paths (gate flow, metrics engine, auth)
- âœ… OAuth2 authentication with role-based access control
- âœ… Production deployment with Apache reverse proxy
- âœ… Password protection for sensitive configuration changes
- âœ… Automatic banner sync from Discord server to bot and website

**Target:**

- ðŸŽ¯ < 1% failed permission checks on logging channel
- ðŸŽ¯ < 100ms p95 response time for API endpoints
- ðŸŽ¯ Zero data loss during metrics epoch resets
- ðŸŽ¯ < 5 seconds dashboard initial load time
