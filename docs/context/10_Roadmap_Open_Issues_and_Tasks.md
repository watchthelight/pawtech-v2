## In Progress

### ðŸš§ Dashboard UI Polish

**Target:** 2025-Q2

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Chart tooltips (hover to see exact counts)
- [ ] Export from graphs (download chart as PNG)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- [ ] Mobile responsive improvements
- [ ] Dark mode toggle (currently locked to dark)
- [ ] Loading skeletons for data fetching

---

## Roadmap

### ðŸŽ¯ PR7: Queue Health & Monitoring

**Target:** 2025-Q2

**Goals:**

- Real-time queue depth tracking
- Stuck claim detection (> 2 hours without decision)
- SLA breach alerting (configurable thresholds)
- Reviewer burnout indicators (consecutive decisions without break)
- Dashboard health widget (queue depth, average wait time, oldest pending)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Add `queue_health` table (snapshot queue state every 5 minutes)
- [ ] Implement stuck claim detection (cron job or scheduler)
- [ ] Create SLA configuration (per-guild thresholds)
- [ ] Add alert notifications (Discord DM to admins or webhook)
- [ ] Build queue health dashboard widget
- [ ] Add burnout scoring algorithm (consecutive actions, time since break)

**Related Issues:**

- Moderators reporting "forgot I had a claim" â†’ auto-unclaim after timeout
- Long wait times during off-peak hours â†’ need visibility

---

### ðŸŽ¯ PR8: Modmail Enhancements

**Target:** 2025-Q2

**Goals:**

- Rich embed support for ticket replies
- Attachment forwarding between DMs and threads
- Canned response templates
- Tag system for ticket categorization
- Ticket search and filtering

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement embed serialization (Discord DM â†’ thread)
- [ ] Add attachment proxy (forward files bidirectionally)
- [ ] Create canned response storage (`modmail_templates` table)
- [ ] Build tag system (tags: `billing`, `support`, `report`)
- [ ] Add ticket search API (`GET /api/modmail?search=...`)
- [ ] Dashboard: Modmail tab with filters and search

**Related Issues:**

- Moderators manually typing common responses â†’ need templates
- Difficult to find old tickets â†’ need search
- No way to categorize tickets â†’ need tags

---

### ðŸŽ¯ PR9: Advanced Analytics

**Target:** 2025-Q3

**Goals:**

- Time-to-first-touch metric (submission â†’ first moderator view)
- Reviewer efficiency scoring
- Predictive workload modeling (forecast queue depth)
- Cohort analysis (approval rates by join source)
- Retention tracking (approved users still active after 30 days)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Add `action_log.action = 'view'` for card views (currently not tracked)
- [ ] Calculate time-to-first-touch percentiles
- [ ] Design efficiency score algorithm (weighted: speed + accuracy + volume)
- [ ] Implement ML model for queue depth forecasting (ARIMA or Prophet)
- [ ] Add join source tracking (invite link â†’ UTM params)
- [ ] Build retention cohort analysis (SQL + visualization)

**Related Issues:**

- No visibility into how long applications sit unclaimed
- Hard to identify "best" moderators (need composite score)
- Can't predict staffing needs during events

---

### ðŸŽ¯ PR10: Observability & Polish

**Target:** 2025-Q3

**Goals:**

- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Prometheus metrics export
- Error rate alerting

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Replace Pino with structured logger (add correlation IDs)
- [ ] Instrument code with OpenTelemetry spans
- [ ] Export metrics to Prometheus (action counts, response times, error rates)
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards (system health, business metrics)
- [ ] Add alerting rules (error rate > 5%, p95 > 1 hour, queue depth > 50)
- [ ] Document observability setup in runbook

**Related Issues:**

- Hard to debug cross-service issues (need tracing)
- No proactive alerting (only reactive monitoring)
- Metrics scattered across logs and database

---

## Known Issues

### Role Resolver Failure States

**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Dashboard may show "Unknown Role" for deleted roles

**Symptoms:**

- Mod role deleted from Discord
- Dashboard still tries to resolve role by ID
- Displays "Invalid role ID" or "Unknown Role"

**Workaround:**

- Admin panel: Config â†’ Remove deleted role from mod_role_ids
- Or: Manually edit `guild_config.mod_role_ids` in database

**Fix Plan:**

- PR7: Add role validation on fetch (skip deleted roles)
- Cache role deletions to avoid repeated API calls

---

### Sparse Data Graphs Show Misleading Trends

**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Graphs with few data points show exaggerated spikes/drops

**Symptoms:**

- Joinâ†’Submit ratio graph with 2-3 data points
- Line connects points with steep slopes (looks volatile)
- Actual trend may be flat or gradual

**Workaround:**

- Dashboard: Use longer time window (30 days instead of 7 days)
- Or: Add disclaimer text: "Data insufficient, use longer window"

**Fix Plan:**

- PR7: Show confidence intervals on graphs
- Add minimum data point threshold (e.g., "Need 10+ days for accurate trend")

---

### Fallback JSON Logs Not Automatically Imported

**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Actions logged to JSON during channel downtime not visible in dashboard

**Symptoms:**

- Logging channel down (permissions issue, channel deleted)
- Actions written to `data/action_log_fallback.jsonl`
- Dashboard shows gap in action timeline

**Workaround:**

- Manual import: `npm run import:fallback-logs`
- Or: Use SQL to insert from JSONL file

**Fix Plan:**

- PR7: Auto-detect fallback log growth, prompt admin to import
- Add `/admin/import-logs` page with one-click import

---

### Test Flakiness on CI (Race Conditions)

**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Occasionally failing tests in GitHub Actions

**Symptoms:**

- Tests pass locally but fail in CI
- Random failures (not reproducible)
- Usually cache-related or timing-related

**Workaround:**

- Run tests serially: `vitest --threads=false`
- Clear caches in `afterEach` hooks
- Use unique IDs per test

**Fix Plan:**

- PR7: Refactor tests to use in-memory database per test
- Add test isolation best practices to contributing guide
