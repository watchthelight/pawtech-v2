## Overview

Pawtropolis Tech Gatekeeper is a server-owned verification system that modernizes community onboarding through structured application flows. It replaces manual DM-based screening with an elegant, permission-gated workflow that keeps staff accountable and applicants informed.

**Core Philosophy:**

- Transparency over opacity
- Auditability over trust
- Minimal surface area over feature bloat

This bot was built for communities that take moderation seriously and want their tooling to reflect that.

---

## Features

### Application Gating

- Interactive modal forms with multi-page question flows and draft persistence
- Configurable per-guild questions via SQLite schema
- Draft recovery for incomplete applications
- Submission validation with required field enforcement

### Review & Decision Making

- Reviewer dashboards with rich embeds, applicant context, and action buttons
- Claim system to prevent review collisions via exclusive locks
- Full audit trail of approve/reject/kick decisions
- Permanent rejection feature to block repeat applications

### Modmail System

- Private thread bridge for staff-applicant DM routing
- Automatic transcript logging as .txt exports to configured channels
- Bidirectional message forwarding with reply threading
- Auto-close on decision when applications are resolved

### Avatar Risk Analysis

- ONNX-based NSFW detection for content moderation
- Edge score analysis for skin tone boundary detection
- Community-specific furry/scalie classification heuristics
- Google Lens integration for one-click reverse image search

### Deployment & Operations

- PowerShell-based remote deployment via slash commands
- Health monitoring with uptime checks and diagnostics
- Sentry integration for error tracking with breadcrumbs and user context
- Pino-based structured JSON logging with trace IDs

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher
- A Discord bot token ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- SQLite 3 (bundled via better-sqlite3)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/watchthelight/pawtropolis-tech.git
cd pawtropolis-tech

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configuration

Edit `.env` with your bot credentials:

```env
# Required: Bot authentication
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_application_id_here

# Optional: Guild-specific deployment (leave empty for global)
GUILD_ID=

# Optional: Sentry error tracking
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Optional: Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Optional: Avatar scanning
GATE_SHOW_AVATAR_RISK=1

# Optional: Reset password for /gate reset

### Database Schema

The bot auto-creates SQLite tables on first run:

- `guild_config`: Per-guild settings (channels, roles, thresholds)
- `guild_question`: Application questions
- `application`: Applicant submissions and drafts
- `application_response`: Question answers
- `review_card`: Reviewer dashboard message tracking
- `modmail_ticket`: Modmail thread state
- `avatar_scan`: Avatar risk analysis results

Schema migrations run automatically via [src/db/ensure.ts](src/db/ensure.ts).

## Quick Start

After deployment and command registration, configure the gate system:

### Initial Setup

```bash
# 1. Run /gate setup in your server
/gate setup review_channel:#staff-review gate_channel:#gate general_channel:#general accepted_role:@Verified

# 2. Customize gate questions (optional)
/gate set-questions q1:"What is your age?" q2:"How did you find us?" q3:"Why do you want to join?"

# 3. Preview current questions
/gate set-questions

# 4. Test the welcome message
/gate welcome preview
```

### Common Commands

**Gate Management:**
- `/gate setup` — Initialize guild configuration
- `/gate set-questions` — Update verification questions (q1..q5)
- `/gate status` — View application statistics
- `/gate config` — Display current configuration
- `/gate welcome set` — Update welcome message template

**Review Workflow:**
- `/accept @user [reason]` — Approve application
- `/reject @user reason:"Account too new"` — Reject with reason
- `/kick @user reason:"Spam"` — Reject and kick
- `/unclaim @user` — Release claimed application

**Moderation:**
- `/modstats` — View personal moderator statistics
- `/modstats leaderboard` — View top moderators
- `/send channel:#general message:"..."` — Send anonymous staff message

**Admin Operations:**
- `/modstats reset password:"..."` — Clear and rebuild moderator statistics cache
  - Requires `RESET_PASSWORD` environment variable to be set
  - Password is validated using constant-time comparison (secure against timing attacks)
  - Rate-limited to 1 attempt per 30 seconds per user
  - All attempts are audit-logged to the configured logging channel
  - The provided password is never logged or persisted

For full command reference, see [docs/context/03_Slash_Commands_and_UX.md](docs/context/03_Slash_Commands_and_UX.md).

## Remote Deployment

The bot includes PowerShell-based remote deployment automation for Windows servers.

### Deployment Prerequisites

- WinRM enabled on remote server
- PowerShell remoting configured
- PM2 installed on remote server

### Deployment Workflow

1. Build the project locally: `npm run build`
2. Transfer `dist/` to remote server via rsync/scp
3. Restart PM2 process via PowerShell remoting

See [scripts/deploy-commands.ts](scripts/deploy-commands.ts) for implementation details.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Appearing

- Run `npm run deploy:cmds` to register slash commands
- Check that the bot has `applications.commands` scope
- Verify `CLIENT_ID` matches your application ID

### Modmail Not Routing

- Ensure bot has `ManageThreads` and `SendMessagesInThreads` permissions
- Configure `mod_role_ids` via `/config set mod_role_ids role1,role2`
- Check that modmail threads are created in a text channel (not DMs)

### Avatar Scanning Fails

- Verify ONNX runtime dependencies are installed: `npm rebuild onnxruntime-node`
- Check that user avatars are accessible (not blocked by privacy settings)
- Review logs for model loading errors

### Permission Errors

Bot must be invited with `Administrator` or granular permissions:

- `Manage Roles`
- `Manage Channels`
- `Manage Messages`
- `Manage Threads`
- `View Channels`
- `Send Messages`
- `Embed Links`
- `Attach Files`
- `Read Message History`
- `Use External Emojis`

### Database Corruption

- Backup your database regularly: `cp data/data.db data/data.db.backup`
- Use SQLite integrity check: `sqlite3 data/data.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"`
- Schema migrations are idempotent and safe to re-run
